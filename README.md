# Metal vs OpenGL
This is the result of a scientific initiation I did in 2020 at Mackenzie University.

In efforts to compare the performance between Metal and OpenGL, I developed two 3D rendering applications, one for each graphics API. 
With a basic rendering pipeline and Phong shading model, I measured and compared the time to render the same 3D scenes with increasing poly-count.
